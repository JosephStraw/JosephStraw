Hello, this is my Github's README file. If you didn't know that but you still found yourself here, god be with you.
I'm pretty useless at the whole programming thing, but i'm trying to improve my skills and understanding of it, and by creating this Github page I hope to put forward my code into the public eye, so I may recieve some constructive criticism (in an ideal world anyway XD)
I'm also about to embark onto a 2 year diploma course in Information systems so knowing how to program in at least 1 language will prove itself to be pretty useful!

:)
